## Personal Goals of each Team member

### Lenja

### Kira
One of my goals for this project is to further develop my programming skills. So far I had no/little experience with GitHub, so it is important for me to learn how GitHub works, how to work with repositories and how to collaborate with other people in the group. Another important goal for me is to improve my time management. Especially when working on tasks and submissions, I want to be more structured so that I can better plan both the workload and the quality of the results.  

### Debbie
For this project, I want to familiarize myself with Python as a new programming language. I also want to build on my existing programming skills and use them to become more familiar with Python. Another important goal for me is to learn how to work with APIs and integrate them into applications. Furthermore, I'm excited to learn how to build a complete web app from scratch and what steps are necessary to do so, so that I can build my own web application in the future.
