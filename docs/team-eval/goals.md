# Project Goals: Achievements and Misses
Our goal as a team was to develop a modern web application that connects people in the same city or region to engage in shared sports activities. This project was intended to go beyond implementing basic featuresâ€”it was designed to be technically robust, user-friendly, and scalable.

# What We Achieved
We successfully built a fully functional platform, allowing users to create individual profiles, specify their fitness level, preferred sports, availability, and other criteria. These details are used to match users with similar interests, fulfilling one of our primary objectives.

Another major accomplishment was the event creation and participation feature, enabling users to organize group activities and discover local fitness events. This significantly enhanced user engagement, allowing for both one-on-one training and group-based activities.

From a technical perspective, we implemented a PostgreSQL database for better scalability, ensuring efficient data management for user profiles, events, and matches. Our backend, built with Flask, integrates seamlessly with the frontend, which is structured using Bootstrap for an intuitive UI design. The "Like" feature was another highlight, allowing users to express interest in training partners, with contact details only being shared when a mutual match occurs.

Additionally, we maintained structured collaboration throughout the project, holding weekly meetings to track progress, resolve challenges, and refine our approach.

# What We Missed
While we accomplished our core goals, some of the more ambitious features could not be fully realized due to time constraints:

- **Search Function:** Originally, we planned to implement a search function that would allow users to find potential training partners based on specific fitness studios, fitness level or favorite activities. While this was not completed, the current implementation allows users to specify their Profile manually and search in User Overview for potential training partners.
- **Integrated Chat Functionality:** To improve communication between matched users, we initially considered a built-in chat feature. Due to the complexity of real-time messaging, we decided to prioritize core functionalities and leave this feature for future development.

# Conclusion
Despite not implementing all planned features, FitConnect successfully delivers on its core purpose: providing users with an intuitive way to find workout partners and join fitness events. The foundation is solid, and the app is scalable for future enhancements such as chat integration and a location-based studio search.

This project pushed us to tackle real-world challenges, refine our development skills, and ensure a well-functioning product within our given timeline. We are proud of what we have achieved and see great potential for FitConnect's future evolution. 

## Personal Goals of each Team member

### Lenja
One of my main goals for this project is to deepen my programming skills and learn a new programming language, such as Python. Additionally, I want to improve my soft skills, particularly in teamwork and communication. By participating in regular team meetings and maintaining continuous exchange within the group, I aim to develop a better understanding of effective collaboration. This will help ensure that we work together efficiently and achieve our goals successfully as a team.

### Kira
One of my goals for this project is to further develop my programming skills. So far I had no/little experience with GitHub, so it is important for me to learn how GitHub works, how to work with repositories and how to collaborate with other people in the group. Another important goal for me is to improve my time management. Especially when working on tasks and submissions, I want to be more structured so that I can better plan both the workload and the quality of the results.  

### Debbie
For this project, I want to familiarize myself with Python as a new programming language. I also want to build on my existing programming skills and use them to become more familiar with Python. Another important goal for me is to learn how to work with APIs and integrate them into applications. Furthermore, I'm excited to learn how to build a complete web app from scratch and what steps are necessary to do so, so that I can build my own web application in the future.
