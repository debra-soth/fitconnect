# Request for Individual Evaluation
Throughout this project, each team member contributed to different aspects based on their strengths and expertise. While we collaborated effectively as a group and maintained open communication, the actual workload was not evenly distributed among all members.

To ensure a fair assessment, we kindly request an **individual evaluation of contributions** rather than a collective grade. Some tasks, particularly in backend development, database integration, and core functionality implementation, required significantly more time and effort compared to other areas. While we fully support a team-oriented approach, we believe that acknowledging individual contributions would better reflect the actual work invested by each member.

That being said, we want to emphasize that we worked together productively and professionally, helping each other whenever possible. Our goal was to create a functional and user-friendly application, and despite the differences in workload, we are proud of what we have achieved as a team.
