# How we would improve next time
Even though we followed the time plan during multiple steps, we could have had a better time management and secure that all steps are done as specified before. With that also comes, that each group member has their own schedule of work during the week, which is why an earlier date to distribute responisbilities could lead to a better working proccess.
