## Time Management
Even though we followed the time plan during multiple steps, we could have had better time management to ensure that all tasks were completed as planned. One key improvement would be setting clearer milestones earlier in the project to avoid last-minute stress and ensure a steady workflow.

## Task Distribution
Since each group member has their own individual schedule and availability, distributing responsibilities earlier in the process could lead to a more structured and efficient collaboration. This would also help in balancing the workload more evenly among all members.

## Code Integration & Version Control
Another aspect we could improve on is code integration and version control. While we used GitHub to manage our repository, we sometimes encountered conflicts due to overlapping work or different coding styles. Establishing stricter Git workflows and conducting more frequent merges could prevent such issues and make collaboration smoother.

## User Testing & Feedback
User testing and feedback collection could have been incorporated earlier in the process. While we conducted a user evaluation towards the end, gathering feedback at multiple stages of development would have allowed us to iterate on our design and functionality more effectively.

## Documentation Process
Finally, improving our documentation process during development rather than at the end would make it easier to track progress, justify decisions, and ensure that all features are well documented for future reference or potential handovers.

By applying these improvements in future projects, we can optimize our workflow, enhance collaboration, and ultimately deliver an even more refined and user-friendly product.
