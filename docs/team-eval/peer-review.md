## Debra Soth - Review 

### My observation  
At the beginning, the group project worked well, with everyone contributing effectively. However, as time went on, different priorities emerged, making it harder to navigate the project, align tasks, and maintain momentum. Communication and task distribution became more challenging.  

### Effect on me 
This shift made the project feel less structured and more stressful, as deadlines became harder to meet and responsibilities were sometimes unclear. It also highlighted the importance of proactive communication and adaptability in teamwork.  

### Tip for the future  
For future projects, it would help to establish clearer long-term planning, regular check-ins, and defined roles to keep everyone aligned. More structured communication and accountability could prevent misunderstandings and ensure steady progress throughout the project.

## Lenja Krah - Review  

### My observation  
Throughout the project, I was highly engaged in the technical implementation and development of the core functionalities. While collaboration was generally smooth, there were challenges in balancing the workload. Some tasks, especially those related to backend development, required significantly more effort and troubleshooting than anticipated. Additionally, differences in working styles made coordination difficult at times.  

### Effect on me  
As a result, I often felt a strong sense of responsibility for ensuring key functionalities were completed on time. This increased my workload and occasionally led to time pressure. Despite these challenges, I gained valuable experience in problem-solving, working under tight deadlines, and managing complex integrations.  

### Tip for the future  
For future projects, a more balanced task distribution and earlier identification of workload disparities would be beneficial. Regular check-ins to reassess the scope of each memberâ€™s responsibilities and ensure an equitable division of labor could improve efficiency and reduce stress. Additionally, clearer communication about individual strengths and technical expertise could help in assigning tasks more strategically.
