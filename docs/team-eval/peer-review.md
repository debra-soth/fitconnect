## Debra Soth - Review 

### My observation  
At the beginning, the group project worked well, with everyone contributing effectively. However, as time went on, different priorities emerged, making it harder to navigate the project, align tasks, and maintain momentum. Communication and task distribution became more challenging.  

### Effect on me 
This shift made the project feel less structured and more stressful, as deadlines became harder to meet and responsibilities were sometimes unclear. It also highlighted the importance of proactive communication and adaptability in teamwork.  

### Tip for the future  
For future projects, it would help to establish clearer long-term planning, regular check-ins, and defined roles to keep everyone aligned. More structured communication and accountability could prevent misunderstandings and ensure steady progress throughout the project.
