### Goal

The goal of this user evaluation was to test the usability of FitConnect and determine whether users could easily register, browse profiles, send likes, and join events. The focus was on evaluating how intuitive the navigation is and whether users understood the concept of the app. Additionally, we aimed to gather feedback on potential improvements to enhance the user experience.

### Method

Five participants were selected for the evaluation, all of whom are interested in fitness and social interaction—the primary target audience of FitConnect. The tests were conducted remotely via Microsoft Teams, with participants gaining access to a laptop running the application.

At the beginning of the session, they were briefly introduced to the concept of the app before navigating through its core features on their own. These features included registering, customizing their profile, browsing users and events, sending likes, and joining events. Afterward, they provided their impressions and suggestions for improvements.

### Results

Overall, the participants found the app easy to navigate and well-structured. The registration process was straightforward, and users had no trouble logging in. The clean design and clear navigation were praised, as they made it simple to explore different sections of the app.

However, some areas for improvement were identified:

- **Own Profile in User Overview:** Users found it confusing to see their own profile in the user overview, as they cannot like themselves.
- **Like Button Visibility:** Previously, the "Like" button remained visible even after sending a like. Users found this misleading, as they weren’t sure if the action had been registered.
- **Join Event Button:** The "Join Event" button was displayed even if the user had already joined the event or if the event was full, leading to unnecessary confusion.
- **Participant Display in Events:** Users noted that in the event details, participant names were not visible—only user IDs were displayed, making it difficult to recognize attendees.

### Implications

Following the evaluation, we implemented several improvements to enhance the user experience:

- **Own Profile Visibility:** In an upcoming update, we will adjust the user overview so that users do not see their own profile listed among potential matches.
- **Like Button Update:** To prevent confusion, we replaced the "Like" button with a message that now displays "You have already liked this person." or "You are already matched!" instead.
- **Join Event Button Fix:** Now, if a user has already joined an event or if it is full, they will see "You are already participating!" or "This event is full. No more spots available." instead of the join button.
- **Participant Display Improvement:** We replaced user IDs with first names in event participant lists, making it clearer who is attending.

These changes have made FitConnect more intuitive and user-friendly, improving clarity and reducing potential misunderstandings. The evaluation confirmed that the platform effectively connects fitness enthusiasts and helps them find training partners, while the implemented improvements further streamline the experience.
