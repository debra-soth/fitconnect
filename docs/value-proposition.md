## The problem

Many people find it hard to stay motivated and consistent with their fitness routines, especially when working out alone. It’s not just about the lack of motivation—loneliness can make it even harder, especially in cities where it’s tough to form real connections. On top of that, finding a workout partner with similar interests and goals can feel overwhelming and time-consuming.

Even when someone does want to work out with others, planning and coordinating sessions often adds extra stress, making it harder to stick to a regular routine. Without structure or consistency, progress slows down, and workouts can become less enjoyable, leading to even less motivation.

## Our solution

Our app is a simple and practical way to help people stay motivated and connected in their fitness journey. It focuses on building a community where users can find training partners with similar goals and interests, making workouts more enjoyable and consistent.

The app features a User Overview, where all registered users are listed. From there, you can check out detailed profiles to find potential training partners. If someone seems like a good match, you can send them a "like." Contact details, like email addresses, are only shared if the other person likes you back, creating a match. This ensures connections are mutual and respectful.

By making it easy to find the right partner and build connections, the app helps tackle loneliness and lack of motivation. While it doesn’t promise to fix everything, it gives users the tools to create better fitness habits and enjoy the process with others. It’s about making fitness more social, simple, and effective.

## Target user

Our target users are individuals of all ages  who are looking to combine fitness with social interaction. They are often people who have recently moved to a new city, such as students like Laura, or those who feel isolated in an urban environment and are open to making new connections. The app aims to attract users who value both the social and athletic aspects of training, helping them find like-minded partners for shared sports activities.

Take Laura as an example: a 21-year-old full-time student who recently moved to Berlin for her studies. She is outgoing, enjoys being around people, and is motivated to lead a healthier lifestyle. However, she struggles with loneliness and lacks a consistent workout routine. The app would help Laura find others who share her interests in jogging and tennis, offering her the chance to meet new people while building healthy habits.

On the other hand, the app also caters to users like Martin, a 32-year-old recruiter who is introverted but dedicated to his fitness goals. Although he prefers smaller social interactions, Martin is looking for reliable training partners who share his interest in activities like bouldering and cycling. The app provides him with a platform to connect with like-minded individuals without the overwhelm of large group settings.

By focusing on this demographic, the app creates an inclusive space for people at various fitness levels and with different social preferences, bridging the gap between fitness and forming meaningful connections.

## Customer journey

The customer journey begins when the user downloads the app and lands on the login screen. If they don't have an account, they select "Don't have an account? Create one!" to register by entering their username, name, email, and password. After registering, they log in and arrive at the User Overview, the main hub displaying all registered users.

Before exploring others, the user can personalize their own profile by clicking "Personalize Profile" in the navigation bar. Here, they add details like fitness preferences, availability, fitness level, gym memberships, and a profile photo. This step ensures others can understand their goals and interests. 

Back in the User Overview, the user browses profiles and can view detailed information on potential training partners. If they find someone suitable, they click "Send like" to express interest. A connection is made only if the other user also sends a like, creating a mutual match.

Matched users appear in the "Your Matches" screen, accessible from the navigation bar. Here, they can view their matches and find contact information (email addresses) to reach out and coordinate workouts.

This journey allows users to easily register, customize their profile, explore others, and form meaningful connections, making it simple to find training partners and combine fitness with social engagement.
